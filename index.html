        <p>Throughout the Pandemic many new hobbies and  pastimes <br>were developed with hopes of entertaning ourselves <br>given the <strong>sudden</strong> and <strong>imediate devesation</strong>  of our social lives</p>
        <p>I bounced from crochet to baking to painting and I even ran...<em>once</em> </p>  
        
    <p>Nevertheless, throughout the months of quaratine what I <strong>really</strong> wanted to get into was <em>reading.</em></p>
